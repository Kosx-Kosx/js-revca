    <h1>Introduction: Reversible Cellular Automata</h1>
    <p>
      The program simulates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cellular_automaton">reversible 2-state block celular automata with Margolus neighbourhood</a>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div class="quote-title">Wikipedia</div>
      <p>A block cellular automaton consists of the following components:
      <ul>
	<li>A regular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(group)" title="Lattice (group)">lattice</a> of cells</li>
	<li>A finite set of the states that each cell may be in</li>
	<li>A partition of the cells into a uniform <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation" title="Tessellation">tessellation</a> in which each tile of the partition has the same size and shape</li>
	<li>A rule for shifting the partition after each time step</li>
	<li>A transition rule, a function that takes as input an assignment of states for the cells in a single tile and produces as output another assignment of states for the same cells.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
	The simplest partitioning scheme is probably the Margolus neighborhood, named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Margolus">Norman Margolus<a>, who first studied block cellular automata using this neighborhood structure. In the Margolus neighborhood, the lattice is divided into 2-cell blocks (or 2 × 2 squares in two dimensions, or 2 × 2 × 2 cubes in three dimensions, etc.) which are shifted by one cell (along each dimension) on alternate timesteps.

    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <h2>Transition rule encoding</h2>
    <p>For block cellular automata rule is a transfer function that calculates next state of the block from the current state. For <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_cellular_automaton">cellular automaton to be reversible</a>, such function should, indeed, be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function">invertible</a>.
      Since in the Margolus neighborhood block consists of 4 cells and there are 2 possible cell states, 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 possible blocks exist:
      <figure> 
	<table>
	  <thead>
	    <tr>
	      <th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>...</th><th>15</th>
	    </tr>
	  </thead>
	  <tbody>
	    <tr>
	      <td><span class="cellicon icon-cells_0"></span></td>
	      <td><span class="cellicon icon-cells_1"></span></td>
	      <td><span class="cellicon icon-cells_2"></span></td>
	      <td>...</td>
	      <td><span class="cellicon icon-cells_f"></span></td>
	  </tbody>
	</table>
	<figcaption>Some of the possible block states.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
      A transition rule must assign a descendant state for each of the 16 original states. If the rule is invertible, the assignment must be a one-to-one relation; in other words - it must be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutation</a> of 16 elements.
      In the simulator, rules are represented as arrays of 16 integers from 0 to 15. 

      For example, <span class="rule">(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16)</span> is the identity rule that does not changes any cells. The cellular automaton with this rule is rather boring though: under this rule, any configuration of cells remains unchanged forever. It is easy to see that such rule is, indeed, reversible.
    </p>
    <p>
      More interesting rule is the &ldquo;Billiard Ball Machine&rdquo;, described by the permutation: <span class="rule">(0,8,4,3,2,5,9,7,1,6,10,11,12,13,14,15)</span>. It is hard see from the numbers themselves, but this automaton exhibits behavior, resembling bouncing billiard balls and walls:
      <figure>
	<img src="images/bbm-demo.gif" alt="BBM cellular automaton"/>
	<figcaption>Behavior of the BBM cellular automaton resembles bouncing billiard balls.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      This and some other rules are listed <a href="">here</a> (all rules from this list are present as predefined rules in the simulator program).
    </p>

    <h2>Rule invariants</h2>
    <p>
      Contrary to the well-known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Life</a> cellular automaton, block automata with Margolus neighborhood has no (1,0) and (0,1) translation symmetry. Instead, they only have the (2,0) and (0,2) symmetries. This means that shift by 1 cell turns a figure into completely different one.
      <figure>
	<img src="images/ss-and-osc.png"/>
	<figcaption>Top: P4 orthogonal spaceship. Bottom: P8 oscillator. (Under the &ldquo;Critters&rdquo; rule)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      For example, under the &ldquo;Critters&rdquo; the top figure is a spaceship, and the bottom is an oscillator.
      Only translation by a whole block (2 cells) in any direction leaves behavior of the configuration unchanged - it is guaranteed by construction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rules may have other invariants. The application performs analysis of a rule to determine them. The following invariants are detected:
      <dl>
	<dt>Rotate by 90&deg;</dt>
	<dd>The rule has 4-fold rotational symmetry; transition function commutes with rotation by 90&deg;.
	  For example, spaceship rotated by 90&deg; will remain spaceship but change travel direction.
	</dd>
	<dt>Rotate by 180&deg;</dt>
	<dd>The rule has 2-fold rotational symmetry; transition function commutes with rotation by 180&deg;.
	  4-fold symmetry implies 2-fold too, but converse is not true. If a rule only have 2-fold symmetry, then spaceships in this rule 
	</dd>
	     
	<dt>Horizontal / Vertical / Diagonal flip</dt>
	<dd>The rule has mirror symmetry with axis, oriented horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
	  The &ldquo;Critters&rdquo; rule has mirror symmetry; mirrored configuration will evolve in the same way as original.
	  The &ldquo;Rotations&rdquo; rule <span class="rule">(0,2,8,12,1,10,9,11,4,6,5,14,3,7,13,15)</span> has no such symmetry. For example:
	  <figure> <img src="images/no-mirror-invariance.png"/>
	    <figcaption>Left: P270 orthogonal c/135 spaceship. Right: P664 oscillator. (Under the &ldquo;Rotations&rdquo; rule)</figcaption>
	  </figure>
	</dd>
	<dt>Negation</dt>
	<dd>Under the rules with negation symmetry, evolution of the figure will be the same, if every alive cell is replaced with dead and back.
	  The &ldquo;Rotations&rdquo; rule is negation-invariant.
	  <figure>
	    <img src="images/inverse-glider-rotations.gif"/>
	    <figcaption>An inverted diagonal P9 spaceship: group of dead cells, traveling across the field of alive cells. &ldquo;Rotations&rdquo; rule.
	    </figcaption>
	  </figure>
	</dd>
      </dl>
    </p>
      
    <h2>Conservation law</h2>
    <p>
      Regarding the total number of alive cells in the field, 3 different kind of behavior can be observed:

      <ol>
	<li>Number of alive cells varies. <br/>
	  &ldquo;Tron&rdquo; rule, <span class="rule">(15,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,0)</span> is an example of such behavior.
	  <figure>
	    <img src="images/tron-original.png" alt="Initial configuration"/>
	    <img src="images/tron-12-steps.png" alt="After 12 steps"/>
	    <img src="images/tron-1200-steps.png" alt="After 1200 steps"/>
	    <figcaption>Evolution of the initial 3-cell configuration under the &ldquo;Tron&rdquo; rule on toroidal 64x64 field: initial configuration, after 12 steps, after 1200 steps
	    </figcaption>
	  </figure>
	  Usually, almost any initial configuration tends to grow chaotically in such automata. Numbers of dead and alive cells tending to become nearly equal. Often, resulting pattern is visually indistinguishable from the random noise, though the &ldquo;Tron&rdquo; rule is a counter-example.
	</li>
	<li>Number of alive cells is constant.<br/>
	  &ldquo;Billiard Ball Machine&rdquo; rule is an example. 
	</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Flashing&rdquo; rules, where numbers of alive and dead cells are interchanging on each generation. <br>
	  After 2 generations, number of alive cells returns to the original value, so it can be considered as a special case of the previous type. <br/>
	  The &ldquo;Critters&rdquo; rule is an example.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Dual transform</h2>
    <p>
      Time-inverted block cellular automaton is also block cellular automaton of the same kind.
    Its rule is <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/InversePermutation.html">inverse permutation</a> of the original rule.
    However, there is one more difference: in time-inverted cellular automata, order of phases of the lattice is also inverted. This can be obtained by translating whole field by 1 cell along both axes. In the simulator program, this is called <b>phase shift</b>; buffer content can be phase-shifted with button <span class="button"><span class="icon icon-toggle-phase">(Phase)</span></span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a general case, the inverse rule is completely different from the direct. But for some rules, a simple geometrical relation between direct and inverse rules is present. For example, in the &ldquo;Rotations&rdquo; rule <span class="rule">(0,2,8,12,1,10,9,11,4,6,5,14,3,7,13,15)</span> inverse rule is a mirror image of the direct. In other words, to inverse-transform a configuration, one could first mirror it, then transform it directly, and finally mirror it again. It can be written as:
      <div class="formula">F<sup>-1</sup> = H<sup>-1</sup>&#8728;F&#8728;H</div>
      Where <b>F</b> is a cellular automaton transition function, and <b>H</b> is a horizontal flip transform. 
    </p>
    <h2>Rule vacuum period</h2>
    <p>
      Number of generations, after which empty field (vacuum) returns to its original state. For the population-preserving rules, vacuum period is 1; for the &ldquo;flashing&rdquo; rules it is 2. Some irregular rules can have bigger vacuum periods. For example, asymmetric rule <span class="rule">(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,0)</span> has vacuum period of 7.
    </p>

    <h2>RLE encoding</h2>
    <p>
      For textual representation of configurations, the simplified RLE format is used.
      See details <a href="http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded">here</a>. Only &ldquo;b&rdquo; (dead cell), &ldquo;o&rdquo; (alive cell) and &ldquo;$&rdquo; (newline) characters and digits are supported; space characters are ignored. Example:
      <figure>
	<img src="images/gol-glider.png"/>
	<figcaption> Conway GOL glider. RLE encoding is <span class="rle">2o$obo$o</span>.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      Comments, offset and other features of RLE are not supported.
    </p>
    <h1>Features</h1>
    <h2>Figure analyzer</h2>
    <p>
      Some rules (such as Rotations, Rotations II, III, IV) support spaceships and oscillators with extremely large periods.
      For example, The following spaceship in the &ldquo;Rotations II&rdquo; rule <span class="rule">(0,2,8,12,1,10,9,13,4,6,5,7,3,14,11,15)</span> has period 10896 generations.
      <figure>
	<img src="images/large-period-ss.png"/>
	<figcaption>A spaceship with period 10896. Rule is &ldquo;Rotations II&rdquo;</figcaption>
      </figure>
      Manual classification of such configuraions is therefore nearly impossible. To simplify the work, simulator has the figure analyser feature, enabled by the <span class="button"><span class="icon icon-analyse">(AS)</span></span> button. To use it, select some area on the field and then press the button. Application will try to detect the following information:
      <ul>
	<li>Type of the figure: oscillator, diagonal, orthogonal or slant spaceship.
	</li>
	<li>Period (for spaceships and oscillators).
	</li>
	<li>Offset: how far spaceship travels per one period.
	</li>

	<li>Canonical form of the figure: the most &ldquo;compact&rdquo; of all evolution steps of the figure. Sometimes it is not unique.
	</li>
      </ul>
      Analyzer only tries to evaluate given configuration for a limited number of generations. If this number is exceeded, but cycle is not found, figure type and period will be &ldquo;unknown&rdquo;. By default, limit is 2048 steps, this can be changed on the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; panel.
    </p>

    <h2>Spaceship Catcher</h2>
    <p>
      Enabled by the button: <span class="button"><span class="icon icon-catcher">(Catcher)</span></span>.
      Spaceship catcher is a tool that automatically :
      <ul>
	<li>finds all figures touching the borders of the field,</li>
	<li>removes them from the field,</li>
	<li>analyses and adds canonical form to the current library.</li>
      </ul>
      When enabled, spaceship catcher <b>reseeds</b> the field periodically: the field is cleared and currently selected area is filled randomly. By default, reseed period is 30'000 generations, it can be changed in the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; panel.

      Spaceship catcher can be used to quickly find naturally occurring gliders for the given rule.
    </p>


    <h2>GIF Recorder</h2>
    <p>
      The application can record GIF animations. To start record, press the <span class="button"><span class="icon icon-recordgif">R</span></span>. This will start the recorder. Then let the field evolve for several generations, using play buttons. Each new frame will be added to the GIF image. You will see, how the size of the file in Kb grows. To stop record and get the produced image, press the <span class="button"><span class="icon icon-stopgif">S</span></span> button. Image can be saved using right-click.
    </p>

    <h2>Predefined Rules</h2>
    <p> The simulator contains a set of predefined rules, taken from the <a href="http://psoup.math.wisc.edu/mcell/rullex_marg.html">MCells page</a>.
      Here are they:
